# Assignment
In an APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) yard
You need to build a backend system (using Node.js and MongoDB) that allows a Commission Agent to record a transaction involving a Farmer and a Buyer.
The transaction will include one or more items being sold, along with relevant charge calculations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

---

## üîß Design Decisions & Assumptions

- Used a **modular structure** for maintainable and scalable code.
- Implemented **JWT authentication** for buyer and farmer routes to secure user-specific operations.
- Used **Zod** for input validation across all request bodies to ensure data accuracy.
- Server calculates charges like *User-Charge**, **Labour Charge**, and **so on.** automatically based on item details.
- All transaction-related data (farmer, buyer, items, charges) is stored in a single document for consistency.

## üì¶ Sample Request and Output Format (Optional)
